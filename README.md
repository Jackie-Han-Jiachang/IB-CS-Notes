# CS Notes Summary (IB 2025)

## Computer Networks
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: Short-range (1â€“10m), connects personal devices like phones via Bluetooth or USB; usually peer-to-peer.
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Covers small areas like a building; faster and more secure.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Covers larger areas; typically slower, less secure.
- **Server vs. Client**:
  - Server listens and responds to requests.
  - Client initiates connections and sends requests.

## Network Security
- **Encryption**: Protects data in transit.
- **Firewall**: Filters traffic, blocks unauthorized access.
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**:
  - Creates encrypted tunnels.
  - Enables secure remote access.
  - Requires authentication, tunneling, encryption.

## Wireless Networks
- **WiFi**: LAN, fast but vulnerable to interference.
- **WiMAX**: MAN, covers large areas (~50km), good for rural areas.
- **3G/4G/5G**: WAN, mobile data.

## Networking Standards & Models
- **OSI Model** (7 layers): Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical.
- **TCP/IP Model**: Practical 4-layer model; basis for internet communication.
- **Protocols**: Rules for communication; e.g., HTTP, TLS, FTP.

## Transmission Concepts
- **Data Compression**: Reduces data size for faster transmission.
- **Packet Switching**: Data split into packets; allows multiple paths and conversations.
- **Factors Affecting Speed**: Network congestion, distance, device capability, protocol overhead.

## VLAN & Client-Server
- **Mainframe issues**: Scalability, redundancy, difficult management.
- **Client-Server**: Centralized request-response model.

## Internet & Intranet
- **Internet**: Global network of networks using standard protocols.
- **Intranet**: Private internal network; secure and restricted.
- **Why Share Beyond Intranet**: For client access, collaboration, etc.

## Security Concepts
- **CIA Triad**:
  - **Confidentiality**: Data kept private (via encryption, access controls).
  - **Integrity**: Data is accurate and untampered.
  - **Availability**: Systems are operational when needed.
- **Authentication**: Confirms user identity (e.g., passwords, 2FA).
- **MAC Filtering**: Controls device access via MAC addresses.
- **Anti-Phishing**: Email/message filters, browser protection.
- **Access Rights**: Role-based file permissions.

## Security Techniques
- **Sandboxing**: Runs code in an isolated environment to prevent malware spread.
- **BYOD Risks**: Use MDM (Mobile Device Management), firewalls, sandboxing.

## Summary
This summary outlines key concepts in networking, including architectures, protocols, security, and wireless communication. It also highlights models like OSI/TCP-IP and practical implementations such as VPN, firewalls, and Wi-Fi systems. Security practices are stressed with real-world technologies and methods for data protection and system integrity.
